GNN DATA PREPARATION
================================================================================

[Data Prep] Creating drug classification labels...
  ✓ Created labels for 4110 drugs
  Label distribution:
    0 (Chronic, Broad-Spectrum): 1363 drugs (33.2%)
    1 (Chronic, Specialized): 723 drugs (17.6%)
    2 (Acute, Broad-Spectrum): 702 drugs (17.1%)
    3 (Acute, Specialized): 1322 drugs (32.2%)

[Data Prep] Creating node features (type: full)...
  ✓ Drug features: torch.Size([4110, 4])
  ✓ Disease features: torch.Size([6376, 2])
  ✓ Patient features: torch.Size([2821, 5])

[Data Prep] Creating train/val/test split...
  ✓ Train: 2877 drugs (70.0%)
  ✓ Val:   616 drugs (15.0%)
  ✓ Test:  617 drugs (15.0%)

[Data Prep] Computed class weights:
  Class 0: 0.7539
  Class 1: 1.4212
  Class 2: 1.4637
  Class 3: 0.7772
